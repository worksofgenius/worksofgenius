### Hi, I'm Marisa! 😊

I'm a fullstack developer, project manager, and writer. I blog at [Works of Genius](https://www.worksofgenius.org) about life in Japan and coding.

- 💻 I’m currently working on Pantry, an app to prevent food waste; Kitchen Cart, an app to connect food trucks and local communities; and [several prototypes](https://worksofgenius.org/web-development/).
- 📚 Recently, I've been learning React and Python.
- 📝 Ask me about improving your UX through better writing.
- 📺 [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl-D6htsWBA&list=WL&index=9&t=3649s) my demo of Pantry.
